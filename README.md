# COMPUTING APPROXIMATE MINIMUM SET COVER

                             If we look around, we find many problems and they might have an optimal solution but we may or may not deploy it . We aim to implement the minimum number of sets that cover all of the elements . Picking the optimal  location for a cell tower so that it covers the maximum   number of customers is a clear example which states the necessity of our project.
