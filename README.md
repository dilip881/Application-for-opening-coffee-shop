# Set-Cover-Problem

Consider the problem of selecting the optimal bus routes to place pot hole detectors. Due to the scarcity of the physical sensors, the problem does not allow for placing a detector on every road. The task of finding the maximum coverage using a limited number of detectors could be formulated as a set covering problem. Specifically, giving a collection of bus routes R, where each route itself is divided into segments. The segments of two different routes can overlap, and each segment is associated with a length aj. The goal is then to select the routes that maximize the total covered distance.
